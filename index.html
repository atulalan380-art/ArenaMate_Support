          <p>
            Open the app and tap on the <strong>New Match</strong> or similar button,
            then choose your game type, number of players/teams, and basic settings.
            Confirm to start tracking the match.

          <summary>Why are some options disabled in my version?</summary>
          <p>
            Certain advanced features might be rolled out gradually or unlocked in
            newer updates. Please make sure you are using the latest version of ArenaMate
            from your app store.

          <summary>The app is not saving my latest changes. What can I do?</summary>
          <p>
            First, ensure you have a stable internet connection if your data is synced
            online. If the problem continues, try restarting the app and your device.
            If it still persists, contact support with steps to reproduce the issue.

        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will my match data be lost if I reinstall the app?</summary>
          <p>
            This depends on your platform and whether cloud backup/sync is enabled.
            We recommend taking a backup (if available in your version) before
            reinstalling. You can also send a support request if you are unsure.

        <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>
        <p>How ArenaMate handles your data.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="privacy-content">
        <h3>Data We Access</h3>
        <p>
          ArenaMate primarily stores match configuration, basic stats, and settings
          needed to provide the core app functionality. Exact data stored may vary
          by version and platform.
        </p>

        <h3>Device Permissions</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your platform and usage, ArenaMate may request permissions
          such as storage (to save data locally) or network access (to sync or
          check for updates).
        </p>

        <h3>Third‑Party Services</h3>
        <p>
          Some versions of the app may use third‑party services (for analytics,
          crash reports, or cloud sync). These are used only to improve stability
          and the user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Control</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can clear local app data from your device settings.</li>
          <li>You may revoke permissions such as storage or network access from OS settings (some app features may stop working).</li>
          <li>You can contact support at any time for clarification about stored data.</li>
        </ul>
